# Feature Specification: Huum Sauna CLI Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-simple-cli`
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "a simple CLI app which uses the Huum API to help me manage sauna sessions from the CLI"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start Sauna Session (Priority: P1)

As a sauna owner, I want to start my sauna session remotely from the command line so that the sauna is heated and ready when I arrive.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - remotely starting a sauna is the primary use case for any sauna management tool. Without this, the CLI has no practical value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the start command and verifying the sauna begins heating, delivering immediate value as a standalone MVP.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a Huum sauna device connected to my account, **When** I run the start sauna command, **Then** the sauna begins heating to the target temperature
2. **Given** I have multiple sauna devices, **When** I run the start command with a device identifier, **Then** only the specified sauna starts heating
3. **Given** my sauna is already running, **When** I attempt to start it again, **Then** I receive a clear message that the sauna is already active

---

### User Story 2 - Stop Sauna Session (Priority: P1)

As a sauna owner, I want to stop my sauna remotely from the command line so that I can turn it off safely if my plans change or after I'm done.

**Why this priority**: Essential safety and control feature - users must be able to stop what they started. Critical for P1 as it pairs with starting functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a sauna and then stopping it via CLI, confirming the heating stops and the session ends.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my sauna is currently running, **When** I run the stop sauna command, **Then** the heating stops and the session ends
2. **Given** my sauna is not running, **When** I attempt to stop it, **Then** I receive a clear message that no active session exists
3. **Given** I have multiple devices running, **When** I run the stop command with a device identifier, **Then** only the specified sauna stops

---

### User Story 3 - Check Sauna Status (Priority: P2)

As a sauna owner, I want to view the current status of my sauna from the command line so that I can monitor temperature, heating progress, and session state without opening a mobile app.

**Why this priority**: Important for monitoring but not critical for basic operation. Users can function with start/stop alone, but status checking significantly improves the experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying sauna status at various states (idle, heating, ready) and verifying accurate information is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my sauna is heating, **When** I check the status, **Then** I see the current temperature, target temperature, and estimated time to ready
2. **Given** my sauna is idle, **When** I check the status, **Then** I see that no session is active and current ambient temperature
3. **Given** I have multiple devices, **When** I check status without specifying a device, **Then** I see the status of all my devices

---

### User Story 4 - Set Target Temperature (Priority: P2)

As a sauna owner, I want to specify my desired sauna temperature when starting a session so that the sauna heats to my preferred temperature.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the start command with customization, but starting with default temperatures is acceptable for MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting a session with various temperature values and confirming the sauna heats to the specified target.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to start my sauna, **When** I specify a target temperature within safe ranges, **Then** the sauna heats to that temperature
2. **Given** I specify a temperature outside safe operating ranges, **When** I attempt to start, **Then** I receive an error with acceptable temperature ranges
3. **Given** I start a sauna without specifying temperature, **When** the session begins, **Then** it uses a sensible default temperature

---

### User Story 5 - List Available Devices (Priority: P3)

As a sauna owner with multiple Huum devices, I want to list all my connected saunas so that I can identify which device to control.

**Why this priority**: Only necessary for users with multiple devices. Single-device users can auto-select their only sauna.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting device list and verifying all associated devices are displayed with identifying information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple saunas on my account, **When** I list devices, **Then** I see all devices with names and identifiers
2. **Given** I have one sauna, **When** I list devices, **Then** I see my single device information
3. **Given** I have no devices configured, **When** I list devices, **Then** I receive a helpful message about setting up devices

---

### User Story 6 - View Temperature Statistics (Priority: P3)

As a sauna owner, I want to view historical temperature data so that I can see usage patterns and heating times.

**Why this priority**: This is a "nice-to-have" feature that provides insights but is not essential for the core control loop of the sauna.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the statistics command and verifying that it displays a table or graph of recent temperature readings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** my sauna has been used recently, **When** I request statistics, **Then** I see a table of temperature readings from the last 24 hours.
2. **Given** I want to see the full history for the month, **When** I use an `--all` flag, **Then** the table shows all available data points for the current month.
3. **Given** I prefer a visual representation, **When** I use a `--graph` flag, **Then** the data is displayed as a terminal-based line graph.

---

### User Story 7 - Initial Authentication Setup (Priority: P1)

As a first-time CLI user, I need to authenticate with my Huum account so that the CLI can access my sauna devices.

**Why this priority**: Blocking requirement - no functionality works without authentication. Must be P1 for initial setup, though only run once per installation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the authentication command with valid credentials and verifying subsequent commands can access the Huum API successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have valid Huum account credentials, **When** I run the authentication command, **Then** my credentials are securely stored and validated
2. **Given** I provide invalid credentials, **When** I attempt to authenticate, **Then** I receive a clear error message
3. **Given** I am already authenticated, **When** I run any sauna control command, **Then** it executes without prompting for credentials again

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the internet connection is lost during a command?
- How does the system handle API rate limits from Huum?
- What happens if the Huum API returns unexpected errors?
- How does the CLI behave when authentication tokens expire?
- What happens when a user tries to start a sauna that is offline or unreachable?
- How does the system handle concurrent commands (e.g., starting and stopping simultaneously)?
- What happens if a user's Huum account has no devices associated?
