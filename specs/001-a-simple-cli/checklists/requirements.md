# Specification Quality Checklist: Huum Sauna CLI Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive edge cases covering network, API, and device states
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- All functional requirements are testable
- No implementation details in the specification

**Assumptions Made**:
- Default temperature will be a standard sauna temperature (documented in FR-003)
- "Secure storage" for credentials assumes platform-standard practices
- "Safe operating ranges" for temperature implies manufacturer specifications
- Authentication method follows Huum API's standard authentication flow
- Single device auto-selection is a reasonable UX assumption

The specification successfully focuses on WHAT and WHY without prescribing HOW, making it suitable for non-technical stakeholders while providing clear requirements for implementation planning.
